</code></pre>
<p>On average only about 20-25% of natural born American adults can effectively speak a second language.<br>

<strong>Comparatively The Global Rate of Bilingual Literacy is Much Higher</strong><br>

The colonial history of the English language and its dominance as the language of global commerce and media has cemented its position as the most spoken language in the world by second language learners. Mandarin and Spanish are close behind. However, most Spanish speaking countries and mainland China have relatively high levels of English comprehension. Arguably, there was likely less of of an initiative to teach foreign languages effectively because of the U.S. status as a superpower and the previous lack of population diversity.</p>
